# Wallpaper Of The Day
This script automates changing the desktop wallpaper each day when the computer starts.
The wallpapers are from Microsoft's [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) search engine.

## Installation
1. Download the script.
2. Move the script in `C:\WOTD`.
3. Open a terminal with administrator rights:
`PS C:\WOTD> .\wotd.ps1 install`
4. Reboot your computer and the wallpaper gets automatically applied!

> NB: the script will search for the internet connection every 30 seconds for 5 minutes if it does not find it the first time. Beyond that it will stop.
